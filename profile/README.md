**Providing Smart Contract Security Reviews with the highly efficient security testing tools used by the top companies in Web3.**

An Audit with Zealynx keeps your current code safe now and after any changes you implement later on.
That's accomplished by providing with each audit a test suite of Fuzz tests and Formal Verification.

Contact Us for:
* Smart Contract Security Reviews - Get an Audit with included Fuzz tests and Formal Verification Test suite
* Fuzzing and Formal Verification for your protocol - We use Foundry and Echidna/Medusa (Fuzzing) and Halmos, Kontrol and ityFuzz (FV)
* Smart Contract development - Solidity and Solana development
